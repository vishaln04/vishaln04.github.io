First of all this project clarifies my vision towards the concept of **team**. I am very fortunate to work with the team members--
* [Meghna Ayyar](https://github.com/leomi7)
* [Lakshay Chotiya](https://github.com/Lakshayk)
* [A. Ramakrishna]()
* [Ch. Akhil Sai]()
* [Sandeep Kumar]()
* [Mayank Padshala](https://github.com/mayankpadshala)
* [Arpit Solanki](https://github.com/arpit1997)

The project taught us how a softwre developed. The basic idea is you go through different phases of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) with your SDLC model. Our model was **Iterative Waterfall Model**. The process of developing a software is more important than the developed software. We learn different phases of life cycle--
1. Requirement Phase
2. Designing
3. Coding
4. Testing
5. Deplyment

We also learned *Documentation*, *Conflict Management*, *Time Management*, *Group Interaction* and many more through this process.
