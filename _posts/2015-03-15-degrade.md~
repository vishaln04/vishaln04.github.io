This is semester oriented project based on the curves and **Newton-Rapson Method**. The idea of the project is to make a windows based mobile appication which detects the movement of the mobile.

The *accelerometer* fitted in the mobile phones are used to read the acceleration of the mobile while a *gyrometer* on the other hand measures the angular rotational velocity.
